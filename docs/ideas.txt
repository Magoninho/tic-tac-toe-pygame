# How to make the DRAWINING of player change?

# How to check if the board array is full, and which parts are AVAILABLE?
Checking if the spot is available avoids the player override the play of your opponent (which is unfair :P)
...

# How to check if someone wins? And how to check the directions that the player won (diagonals, etc)
To check that there was a tie, the board must be full AND without any wins.
To someone win, the board can be full or not (because it could be the last play). 
So there are two diferent conditions:
- if the board is full/there's no spots available AND no wins then: tie
- if he have some win : the player wins


# How to draw the line that shows who won?
